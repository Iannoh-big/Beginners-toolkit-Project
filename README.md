# Prompt Kickstart: Building a Beginner’s Toolkit for C++ (CLI Fundamentals)

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a **beginner-friendly toolkit** designed to help new learners get started with **C++ programming on Linux (Ubuntu)** using an interactive **Command Line Interface (CLI)** example.

The project was developed as part of a capstone focused on using **Generative AI prompts** to explore, learn, and document a new technology in software development.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Learn the basics of C++ programming using AI-assisted prompts
* Set up a C++ development environment on Ubuntu
* Build a simple, runnable CLI application
* Document the learning process so others can easily replicate it

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** C++
* **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu)
* **Compiler:** g++ (GNU C++ Compiler)
* **Interface:** Command Line (CLI)
